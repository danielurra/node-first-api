## Let's build our first API
* **Node.js** is a runtime built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, it allows us to run JavaScript outside the browser.<br>
* **Node.js** is a server-side scripting language based on Googleâ€™s V8 Javascript engine.<br>
* **Node js** is a single-threaded, instead of separate processes and threads, it uses asynchronous, event-driven I/O operations.<br>
* **Node js** can achieve high output via single-threaded event loop and non-blocking I/O.<br>
* **Express.js** is a `minimal framework` especially useful for writing RESTful API code.<br>
  **Express.js** offers a broad set of APIs, HTTP methods, and middleware that modern web applications need.<br>
  **Express.js** helps developers to eliminates a lot of boilerplate-type code from their application code.<br>
* **API** (Application Programming Interface), It can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications.<br>
* **REST** stands for `Representational State Transfer` it's a model through which an app can access, create, modify, or delete resources<br>
  **REST** extends the hypertext concepts with a clearly defined and standardized model for retrieving, transferring, and manipulating the state of complex objects across a network.<br>
If you'd like to learn more about REST API and how to build one I do recommend you to take a look at the following blog:
https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/designing-a-rest-api-3a070398750f<br>
**Dick Dowdell** has created such a fantastic article.<br>

**REST** is based on HTTP methods and URL structure.
## Main JavaScript file index.js
![index-js-file](https://github.com/danielurra/node-first-api/assets/51704179/0bc372fa-937b-4f37-9740-aa4e85d2e993)<br>
## Run your app
```bash
node ./index.js
```
## Code with comments - grab the code w/o comments from the repo folder
```javascript
// First, we begin by importing the needed Node.js modules
const express = require ('express');
const fs = require ('fs');
// Reading a file (in Node.js) is accomplished asynchronously by using the file system (fs) module

const app = express();
// here you create an Express application instance
app.get ('/pending_tasks', (req, res) => {
// here you tell the app that for a GET request the URL /pending_tasks, execute the given function.
    fs.readFile(__dirname + '/' + "ptasks.json", 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
        if (err){
           return console.log("err")
        }
        res.send(data)
    } )
})

app.listen(3033, () => {
    // Finally, you just have to start up the Express app by telling it what port to listen on.
    console.log("Web server is running on Port 3033 ");

})
```
## JSON file pretending to be our Data Base
In the real world we don't use a simple file, we make use of Databases<br>
For educational purposes only we are making use of a simple file<br>

## Grab the code
```json
{
    "pend-task#1":{
        "task-id" : 1,
        "task-desc" : "Take code lessons"
    },
    "pend-task#2":{
        "task-id" : 2,
        "task-desc" : "Go to the gym"
    },
    "pend-task#3":{
        "task-id" : 3,
        "task-desc" : "do homework"
    },
    "pend-task#4":{
        "task-id" : 4,
        "task-desc" : "Fix the fence"
    }
}

```
## Package.json file
The `package.json` file is automatically created when you initalize your project by using the following command:
```bash
npm init
```

## Server response - JSON data
I had to install one browser extension to get the Json data properly formatted.<br>
For Google Chrome I did install the extension available at:<br>
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer<br>

## Google chrome developer tools - HTTP method GET
My Mac is now acting as my web/db server, knowing its `IP address` and from any other computer in my home network I can test my API<br>
